‚ö° **Fast Processing**: Optimized for real-time audio processing  

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Method 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Download the setup script and run
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/voice-cloning-studio/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone or download the files
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/voice-cloning-studio.git
cd voice-cloning-studio

# Install system dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install ffmpeg libsndfile1

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv voice_cloning_env
source voice_cloning_env/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run voice-cloning-app.py
```

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. **Song Input & Vocal Separation**
- Upload any audio file (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A)
- AI-powered Spleeter separates vocals from instruments
- Preview isolated vocal and instrumental tracks

### 2. **Voice Model Creation (One-Time)**
- Record 3-5 voice samples using your microphone
- AI trains a personalized singing voice model
- Model is automatically saved for future use

### 3. **Voice Cloning & Replacement**
- AI replaces original vocals with your cloned voice
- Maintains original melody, timing, and style
- Download your personalized singing performance

## üéÆ Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Your Song
1. Click "**1. Upload Song**" in the sidebar
2. Upload an audio file (max 100MB, 5 minutes)
3. Click "üéØ **Separate Vocals and Instruments**"
4. Wait for AI processing (1-3 minutes)

### Step 2: Create Voice Model
1. Click "**2. Create Voice Model**" in the sidebar
2. Record 3-5 voice samples (different phrases recommended)
3. Click "ü§ñ **Train Voice Model**"
4. Model is saved automatically

### Step 3: Generate Clone
1. Click "**3. Generate Clone**" in the sidebar
2. Click "üéµ **Generate My Singing Clone**"
3. Download your AI singing performance

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Customize the application behavior by editing `config.py`:

```python
# Audio settings
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 100
SUPPORTED_AUDIO_FORMATS = ["mp3", "wav", "flac", "m4a"]

# Voice model settings
MIN_VOICE_SAMPLES = 3
RECOMMENDED_VOICE_SAMPLES = 5

# Processing settings
USE_GPU = True
ENABLE_CACHING = True
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### GPU Acceleration
Enable GPU processing for 3-5x faster performance:
```bash
# Install CUDA version of TensorFlow
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.13.0
```

### Professional Voice Models
Integrate advanced models like So-VITS-SVC:
```python
# In config.py
ADVANCED_MODELS = {
    "so_vits_svc": {
        "enabled": True,
        "model_path": "./models/sovits/"
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Local Development
```bash
streamlit run voice-cloning-app.py
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker build -t voice-cloning-studio .
docker run -p 8501:8501 voice-cloning-studio
```

### Cloud Deployment
- **Streamlit Cloud**: Connect your GitHub repository
- **Heroku**: Use the provided Procfile
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Deploy using container services

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"FFmpeg not found"**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org
```

**"Out of memory error"**
- Reduce audio file size or duration
- Close other applications
- Disable GPU acceleration if problematic

**"Microphone not accessible"**
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for microphone)
- Check browser permissions
- Try Chrome browser (recommended)

### Performance Tips
- Use shorter audio clips for testing
- Enable GPU acceleration if available
- Record voice samples in quiet environment
- Use high-quality input audio (44.1kHz+)
