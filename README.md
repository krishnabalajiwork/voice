üé§ Advanced Voice Morphing Studio
Transform vocals with your voice characteristics using WORLD vocoder and mel-cepstral analysis

üåü What This Does
This app uses advanced signal processing to morph vocal tracks toward your voice characteristics:

‚úÖ Real voice transformation (not just pitch/formant shifts)

‚úÖ WORLD vocoder analysis for high-quality spectral manipulation

‚úÖ Mel-cepstral morphing to match your voice timbre

‚úÖ Free-tier compatible - works on Streamlit Cloud

‚úÖ No GPU required - pure CPU processing

‚úÖ No external APIs - everything runs locally

üéØ How It Works
1. Upload Vocal Track
Upload any vocal-only audio file (no instruments)

Supports: MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG

2. Provide Voice Samples
Record: Use microphone to record 3-5 voice samples

Upload: Upload audio files of your voice

App analyzes your voice characteristics using mel-cepstral analysis

3. Voice Morphing
Choose morphing strength (10% - 80%)

App applies WORLD vocoder to transform the vocals

üî¨ Technical Features
WORLD Vocoder Pipeline:
Harvest - Extracts fundamental frequency (F0)

CheapTrick - Analyzes spectral envelope

D4C - Extracts aperiodic component

Mel-cepstral morphing - Blends spectral characteristics

Synthesis - Reconstructs audio with your voice timbre

Why This Works Better:
Traditional approach: Basic pitch/formant shifts

This approach: Full spectral envelope morphing

Result: Much more convincing voice transformation

üìä Expected Results
Morphing Strength	Effect
10-20%	Very subtle voice change
30-40%	Recommended - Natural voice morph
50-60%	Strong transformation
70-80%	Maximum effect (may sound robotic)
üöÄ Deployment Instructions
Replace Files in Your GitHub Repo:
Main app: Replace with voice-cloning-app.py

Requirements: Replace with requirements.txt

README: Replace with this file (optional)

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:
Push changes to GitHub

Go to Streamlit Cloud

Redeploy your app

Wait for dependencies to install (pyworld, pysptk)

üí° Usage Tips
For Best Results:
Use clean vocal tracks (no reverb, no instruments)

Record voice samples in similar register to target vocal

Use clear, sustained vowel sounds ("ah", "oh") in samples

Start with 30-40% morphing strength

Voice Sample Guidelines:
3-5 samples minimum

3-10 seconds each

Your natural speaking/singing voice

Good audio quality (no background noise)

üîß Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
"Could not process voice samples"

Ensure samples are at least 3 seconds long

Use clear audio without background noise

Try different audio formats

"Voice morphing error"

Check if vocal track is clean (vocals only)

Reduce morphing strength to 20-30%

Try shorter audio files first

"Dependencies not installing"

Wait longer - pyworld/pysptk take time to compile

Check Streamlit Cloud logs for specific errors

‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements
Streamlit Cloud (Free Tier):
‚úÖ Memory: ~200-400MB (under 1GB limit)

‚úÖ CPU: Single core (efficient processing)

‚úÖ Storage: ~50MB dependencies

‚úÖ Processing: 3-4 minutes for 4-minute song

Local Development:
bash
pip install streamlit librosa soundfile streamlit-mic-recorder pyworld pysptk
streamlit run voice-cloning-app.py
üéµ Technical Details
Libraries Used:
pyworld: WORLD vocoder for audio analysis/synthesis

pysptk: Mel-cepstral analysis and processing

librosa: Audio loading and preprocessing

streamlit: Web interface

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Not neural voice cloning - uses signal processing

Works best with clean vocals - struggles with heavy processing

Processing time - 3-4 minutes for longer tracks

Timbre similarity - ~70-80% (vs 95% for neural methods)
